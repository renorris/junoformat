# JunoFormat

Fixes formatting issues when copying text from Google Docs to Juno Docs.

## About
* I was prompted to make this because [Juno Docs](https://login.jupitered.com/help/?junodocs) is too crappy to support pasting rich text from Google Docs. 
* This will parse rich text (HTML/CSS) from Google Docs via the clipboard and reduce the formatting to old HTML tags (no CSS) that Juno knows how to read.
* Production server: https://reesed.ga/junoformat

## Disclaimer
* This isn't complete and is guaranteed to have issues. [Leave a bug report!](https://github.com/renorris/junoformat/issues)
