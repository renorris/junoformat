# JunoFormat

Fixes some formatting issues when pasting Google Docs into Juno Docs.

## About
* Reason I made this: [Juno Docs](https://login.jupitered.com/help/?junodocs) is garbage. 
* This will parse HTML/CSS from Google Docs and reduce the formatting to old HTML tags that Juno Docs knows how to read.
* Demo server: https://rnorris.dev/junoformat

## Disclaimer
* This isn't complete and has issues. [Leave a bug report!](https://github.com/renorris/junoformat/issues)
